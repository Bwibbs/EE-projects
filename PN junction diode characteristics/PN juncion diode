This a simple lab where I have two circuits, both with a 30V supply, 1k ohms resistor in series with a diode.  The difference between the circuit is the diodes orientation.
In one circuit the diode is in forward bias position and in the other the diode is in reverse diode position.  In this file I will include calculations and video of the simulations.
